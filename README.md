## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run

First of all, you should create file `.env`. 
> ***All operation methods require this step.***

```env
http_proxy=http://host:port
rapid_api_key=xxxxxxxxxx
EMAIL_TYPE=temp-email44
DEBUG=0
POOL_SIZE=1
```

- `http_proxy`: config your proxy if you can not access target website directly
- `rapid_api_key`: you should config this if you use forefront api, this apikey is used for receive register email, get api key here
- `EMAIL_TYPE`: temp email type includes `temp-email` `temp-email44` `tempmail-lol`
    - [temp-email](https://rapidapi.com/Privatix/api/temp-mail): soft limit 100req/days, if over use money, need bind credit card! Very Stable!
    - [temp-email44](https://rapidapi.com/calvinloveland335703-0p6BxLYIH8f/api/temp-mail44): hard limit 100req/days! Stable!
    - [tempmail-lol](): nothing need, limit 25request/5min. Not Stable.
- `DEBUG`: Valid when use `forefront` You can set =1 when you run local. show reverse process
- `POOL_SIZE`: `forefront` concurrency size. Keep set=1 until you run it successfully!!! You can engage in {POOL_SIZE} conversations concurrently. More pool size, More conversation can be done simultaneously, But use more RAM
